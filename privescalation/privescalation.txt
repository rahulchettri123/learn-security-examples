The vulnerability in the insecure version lies in its lax approach to verifying user identity and permissions. Without proper authentication, anyone could claim to be an administrator and gain unauthorized access to sensitive features. Conversely, the secure version addresses this flaw by implementing robust session-based authentication, ensuring users must prove their identity before accessing privileged actions. By storing user roles securely in sessions, the server can reliably enforce access controls, only permitting administrators to perform admin tasks. Additionally, to bolster security further, measures like stringent input validation, role-based access controls, encrypted communication, and regular security assessments should be employed. These strategies collectively strengthen the application's defenses against privilege escalation and other potential threats.
